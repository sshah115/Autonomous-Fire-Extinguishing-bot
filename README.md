# Autonomous-Fire-Extinguishing-bot
Entire project is focused on the fire detection using digital image processing. In achieving the goal, the project is divided into three subgroups which are: (1) Machine Vision (2) Electronics Circuit (3) Mechanical design | Machine vision is prime component of the project. Here the image processing is done using MATLAB software. Image Processing is implemented because the fire detection task requires fire identification and thereby guiding the bot to reach the fire spot from its rest position to the desired position. Electronics Circuit is based on open source environment Arduino Uno which is interfaced with Bluetooth module and servo motor. Entire bot mobility and fire extinguisher function using servo motor is controlled by programming done in the arduino IDE.
